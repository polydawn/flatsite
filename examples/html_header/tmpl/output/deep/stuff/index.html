<h2>

<p>
	This file is a demonstration of breadcrumbs in header.
</p>
<p>
	The header chrome file is aware that files named "index" are special, and generates breadcrumbs linking only to the directory.
	It's worth noting that the template engine doesn't know a thing about this, and doesn't do anything special to support it &mdash; any header file can do this.
